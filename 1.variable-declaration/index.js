/*
A variable in JavaScript is a container used to store data values. It allows you to assign and manipulate values throughout your programme.

5 things you need to know to declare a variable in JavaScript:

1. Use var/let/const
    a. var (old, avoid using it)
    b. let (preferred for changeable values)
    c. const (preferred for non-changeable values)

2. Variable names must be valid identifiers
    a. it can't start with number
    b. can contain letter, number, _ & $
    c. case sensitive (name & Name are two different variable name)

3. Use meaningful names

4. You don't need to specify the types. JavaScript automatically assigns it

5. Variables are scoped 
    a. var is function scoped
    b. let & const are block scoped
